Create beautiful images and gifs of your source code
I developed an advanced tool using ReactJS and TypeScript that empowers users to effortlessly generate eye-catching images and GIFs of their source code. Leveraging the powerful GIF Shot library, the tool allows users to capture and convert their source code into dynamic and shareable GIFs, providing an engaging and interactive way to showcase their code.

In addition to the GIF Shot integration, the tool features a user-friendly code editor. By incorporating technologies like Code Editor, users can enjoy a seamless coding experience while creating stunning visuals of their source code. The code editor provides a familiar and intuitive interface with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and other helpful features that enhance the coding workflow.
With this feature-rich tool, users can not only write code but also transform it into visually appealing images and GIFs. 

Whether it's for sharing on social media, presenting code snippets in presentations, or simply adding visual interest to their projects, this tool provides a seamless and efficient solution. By combining ReactJS, TypeScript, GIF Shot, and Code Editor technologies, the tool offers a powerful and versatile platform for developers to showcase their coding skills and create captivating visuals of their source code.
